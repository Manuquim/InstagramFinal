  					<p>The Labrador Retriever or simply Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. 
						It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), 
						and was named after the Labrador region of that colony.

  					<p>The Labrador is loyal, obedient and playful. It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a companion dog.
					   It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.</p>

  					<p>The first photograph of the breed was taken in 1857 (the Earl of Home's dog "Nell", described both as a Labrador and a St. John's water dog). 
						By 1870, the name Labrador Retriever became common in England</p>
